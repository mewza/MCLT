This is implementation of the Modulated Complex Lapped Transform by H. Malvar
that I hacked together, similar to FFT, this discrete mathematical algorithm is 
used in similar fashion in the field of digital signal processing.

See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulated_complex_lapped_transform

It works! and it is 1:1 implementation of the algorithm described in the Malvar's
article.
